## Want to try it out?
### Using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) :whale:
- **Run** - `docker-compose up` to spin up development server

### Using directly :computer:
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (if not already installed)
- Go to the root of this project and run: <b>npm install</b> - to install all dependencies for server components
- Go to frontend directory and run: <b>npm install</b> - to install all dependecies for frontent
- Run both FE and BE with <b>npm run start</b> in each terminal window

> **Note** Remember to change default Mongo password

### Long-term ToDo :construction_worker:
- [ ] Swap current csrf with something more "modern"
- [ ] Create bootstrap script to test app locally without docker
- [ ] Update React to current version (or rewrite frontend(?))
